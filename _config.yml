  Materials Scientist and Research Assistant (TATA Fellow)
  <br><br>
  MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
  <br><br>
  I currently focus on developing high-throughput synthesis pathways for accelerated crystallization of industrially attractive Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and Zeolites. 
  Previous experience of 5+ years in Diesel After-treatment System, Lubricants, and Tribology. 
  <br>
  My unique background at the intersection of mechanical engineering, materials science, & chemical engineering, positions me to efficiently tackle real-world challenges. 
  I'm interested in areas related to renewable energy technologies, materials synthesis, crystallization science, techno-economic modelling, energy storage, carbon capture, sustainable water supply, automotive emissions, fuels, and policy.
