## Optimization of Synthesis Space <br>
Synthesis space or reaction space refers to a critical range of process parameters such as molar ratios of reagents in the precursor mixture, residence time, and reaction temperature that dictates the outcomes such as product crystallinity, production rates, crystal size distribution etc.<br>
In most cases involving synthesis of Zeolites or MOFs, there are a large number of parameters to screen; parameters with small response factors are usually held constant while rest of the parameters can have a specified range where experiments are run. <br> 
Below is a test case for NiBTDD MOF, wherein 4 critical process parameters are screened using a continuous flow chemistry platform.<br>
