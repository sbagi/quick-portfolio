## Outlook on PM (Particulate Matter) Emissions and its Effects on Diesel Engines
As emission regulations become more stringent with time that necessitate complex aftertreatment systems, we need a holistic methodology of investigating crankcase soot and exhaust soot to monitor and improve the vehicle drivetrain performance from a fuel-economy and durability perspective. <br> 
One area of practical significance is to understand the relationship between soot inception conditions and oxidative reactivity parameters – the design of particulate filters and operation can be optimized based on soot characteristics such as particle sizes, reactivity, and packing density. <br> 
- Topics pertaining to elucidation of structural, morphological, and oxidative characteristics of turbostratic soot from diesel engines have been of significant interest to me.<br>
- With my previous experience working at a heavy-duty diesel engine OEM, I recognize a wide gap existing between the approach taken by the soot/after-treatment modeling community and the materials characterization community, often leading to discrepancies between input parameters and the model output. <br>
- My recent recearch publications focus on addressing the existing knowledge gaps pertaining to the role of specific parameters such as fuel composition, combustion conditions influencing soot inception in engines, and its subsequent effet on exacerbated engine wear & lower fuel economy (from oil thickening).<br> 
- We published one of the first studies that evaluates the entire ‘soot ecosystem’, taking into account soot inception, structural parameters, soot trapping and oxidation characteristics in a diesel engine vehicle. This is of practical significance to the industry and academia alike. <br> 
- Our studies serve as a benchmark in the field of materials characterization of crankcase and exhaust soot, where methodologies presented can be utilized as a template for others to follow and build off of the results. <br>
