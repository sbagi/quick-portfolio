## Project Overview
<br><br>

- The product design exercise aimed at developing a discreet and stylized case for convinient storage, transportation and tracking the use of medication for adult patients.<br>
- Non-adherence to medication leads to >130,000 preventable deaths in the US every yeay and a detailed market analysis highlighted the need for a product in this category.<br>
- We were a team of 6 graduate students, 3 engineering majors, 2 business majors and 1 design major. Below are some of the highlights from the group project executed in 2017.

### Competitive Market Landscape<br>
Market analysis was conducted to understand the key challenges related to prescribed medication for different patient groups and stakeholders in the healthcare industry, which led to identification of unmet needs that could be addressed with our product.<br>
The healthcare industry is a complex network in which numerous stakeholders work together to help patients manage a variety of diseases and disorders. To navigate this complex industry, we divided the segments that are impacted by prescription medication as “end-users” (i.e. patients and caregivers) and “other stakeholders” (i.e. medical and pharmaceutical industries). <br>

- There are a myriad of products on the market intended to help people manage their medications, from simple plastic weekly medicine planners available at any pharmacy for about $5 to sophisticated tabletop appliance that can automatically sort and dispense medication at the proper time for $1000.<br>
- Thus the competitive landscape can be divided into seven general categories: 1) Current pharmacy pill bottles, 2) Traditional sorters and cases, 3) Medicine bottle cap timers/trackers, 4) Smart medication dispensers and trackers, 5) Smart sorters, dispensers, and trackers, 6) Smart mobile containers, and 7) Pharmacy sorting services. <br>
