## Atmospheric Water Capture <br>
Atmospheric Water Capture (AWC) refers to the capture and collection of water from air in the form of vapor or small droplets and has tremendous potential to address global shortage of clean drinking water.<br>
Based on the RH (Relative Humidity) conditions, AWC methods can vary. For RH>90%, AWC can be accomplished using a simple high-density mesh/warping which can extrct several liters of water per day, at RH>60%, dewing can be used and at low RH below 60% in arid climates, hydrophilic sorbents are the most effective in capturing moisture.<br>  
- MOF (Metal-Organic Framework) sorbents exhibit steep water uptake capacities with cyclic stability and can be regenerated at low temperatures produced by low-grade heat from sunlight.<br>
- MOFs are crystalline coordination complexes consisting of organic linkers and inorganic polynuclear clusters forming highly ordered 2D and 3D structures.<br>
- Ni2Cl2(BTDD), a novel MOF exhibits a record gravimetric water uptake capacity of 0.82 g/g under simulated desert daytime (45 °C, 5% RH) and nighttime (25 °C, 35% RH) conditions is synthesized using a continuous flow chemistry platform.

### Major Outcomes from the Research <br>
- Developed a semi-automated flow synthesis platform with a wide operational window for ultrafast synthesis of MOFs and Zeolites.<br>
- Rapid optimization of synthesis space parameters such as reaction temperature, residence time, amount of solvents with systematic use of DoE (Design of Experiments) to help early stage high-throughput materials discovery. <br>
- Ideal synthesis conditions in flow resulted in reduced methanol and hydrochloric acid volumes in the precursor mixture by 50% and 40% respectively, while achieving threefold increase in productivity compared to batch synthesis. <br>
